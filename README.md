Simple toy application built with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

Just an experiment to figure out how to use Redux for mananging state and handling events in a three.js-based real-time 3D application.
